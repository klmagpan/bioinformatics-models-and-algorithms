# Assignment 4: Clustering Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains the solution for Assignment 4 which involves applying unsupervised learning techniques (K-Means and hierarchical clustering) to the MNIST and Dogs SNP datasets. The goal is to explore clustering methods and evaluate their performance.

## Datasets
MNIST: A dataset of 6000 images of handwritten digits (0-9).
Dogs SNP (Optional): A dataset with genetic data from 1355 dogs, each with 784 SNP features.

## Assignment Breakdown
### Tier 1 (Required)
K-Means Clustering: Perform clustering on the MNIST dataset with K=10 and K=11. Visualize and save the centroids, and calculate clustering errors.
### Extra Credit 1 (Tier 2)
Hierarchical Clustering on MNIST: Perform hierarchical clustering, visualize the dendrogram, and calculate clustering error.
### Extra Credit 2 (Tier 3)
Hierarchical Clustering on Dogs SNP Dataset: Perform hierarchical clustering on the Dogs SNP dataset and calculate the clustering error.
