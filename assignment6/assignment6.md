# Assignment 6: Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
## Overview
This repository contains the solution for Assignment 6, focusing on applying eigenvalues and eigenvectors to the Fibonacci sequence and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to analyze the Dogs dataset. The main objectives are to derive the explicit formula for the Fibonacci sequence using eigenvectors and apply NMF to discover genetic ancestry patterns in dogs.

## Assignment Breakdown
Part 1: Fibonacci Sequence Using Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Use the 2x2 matrix to generate the Fibonacci sequence through matrix multiplication.
Derive an explicit formula for the Fibonacci sequence using eigenvectors, avoiding recursion.
Implement a Python function to calculate the nth Fibonacci term for any starting numbers.
Part 2: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on Dogs Dataset
Apply NMF to decompose the Dogs dataset into two non-negative matrices.
Create a bar plot showing each dog's proportion to five genetic clusters.
Identify the dominant cluster for Basenji and Wolf samples.
Extra Credit 1 (Tier 2): NMF on Protein-Protein Interaction Dataset
Apply NMF to decompose a protein interaction matrix.
Perform hierarchical clustering within the smallest protein cluster.
Visualize the cluster with a heatmap and dendrogram.
