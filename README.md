# bioinformatics-models-and-algorithms
Welcome to my Bioinformatics repository!
This repository contains assignments from the Bioinformatics Models and Algorithms graduate course (BME 205). It features the implementation and analysis of bioinformatics algorithms, including sequence alignment, machine learning, data structures for biological data, and predictive models used in genomics and molecular biology. Below is a brief description of each assignment included in the repository:

## Assignments Overview
### Assignment 3: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
This assignment involves applying PCA to a gene expression dataset, reducing its dimensionality and identifying the most significant components contributing to gene expression patterns. The goal is to explore how PCA can highlight key patterns and variations within large genomic datasets.

### Assignment 4: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
In this assignment, I used NMF to analyze genetic ancestry patterns in dogs. The task was to apply this matrix factorization technique to discover hidden structures in the data and visualize these patterns for genetic analysis.

### Assignment 5: Monte Carlo Simulation of Allele Fixation
This assignment involves simulating allele frequency dynamics in a Wright-Fisher population using Monte Carlo methods. The goal was to estimate the expected number of generations until an allele either fixes or is lost in the population, under different conditions like population size and selection pressures.

### Assignment 6: Fibonacci Sequence via Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
In this assignment, I derived the explicit formula for the Fibonacci sequence using the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This involved applying linear algebra to explore mathematical models in bioinformatics.

### Assignment 7: Breast Cancer Prediction with Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS)
This Kaggle competition-based assignment tasks me with developing a machine learning model to predict breast cancer risk using Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS). The goal was to achieve the highest AUC-ROC score by modeling genetic risk factors that contribute to breast cancer prediction.

### Assignment 8: Hybrid Models for Disease Progression
For this senior capstone project, I am combining Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict disease progression paths from MRI images. The project aims to model how diseases evolve over time, providing insights into patient outcomes and personalized medicine.
